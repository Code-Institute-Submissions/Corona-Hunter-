![](assets/images/responsive.devices.png

This project includes “hunt the virus” a game related to the ongoing Corona crisis in the world. It's based on Minesweeper game and gives the players opportunity to find and kill viruses. Beside the game the page includes an introductory video, to raise the players attention and creates a story motivating the players to play the game. 
From the main menu the users can access the game instruction, and a background page with facts and information about the  Corona virus. And finally a contact page that enables the users to contact me, using an easy contact form. 
For the creation of the page I used html, css, bootstrap 4, javascript, JQuery, Google mail mailJS . 

 
 **Note: The game is based on Minesweeper game function. 

## UX

#### The purpose of the webpage is to give the users opportunity to release stress connected to the ongoing corona crisis, by playfully preventing further infections. It addresses mainly people who like playing logic games and fans of mine sweeper who are looking for a new interpretation of the game.  The user will be able to have a fun game experience while learning about  an ongoing societal issue. They can contact me for further information about the game or question related to site development.
