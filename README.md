# Milestone Project 2: Hunt The Virus 


![](assets/images/responsive.devices.png

This project includes “hunt the virus” a game related to the ongoing Corona crisis in the world. It's based on Minesweeper game and gives the players opportunity to find and kill viruses. Beside the game the page includes an introductory video, to raise the players attention and creates a story motivating the players to play the game. 
From the main menu the users can access the game instruction, and a background page with facts and information about the  Corona virus. And finally a contact page that enables the users to contact me, using an easy contact form. 
For the creation of the page I used html, css, bootstrap 4, javascript, JQuery, Google mail mailJS . 

 
 **Note: The game is based on Minesweeper game function. 

## UX

#### The purpose of the webpage is to give the users opportunity to release stress connected to the ongoing corona crisis, by playfully preventing further infections. It addresses mainly people who like playing logic games and fans of mine sweeper who are looking for a new interpretation of the game.  The user will be able to have a fun game experience while learning about  an ongoing societal issue. They can contact me for further information about the game or question related to site development.

## Wireframes
#### For the creation of my wireframes I used the Balsamiqu program (see “technologies used). Throughout the development of the webpage the wireframes were very helpful for me to reach the final design.
#### I have created mobile wireframes and desktop wireframes.

## Features:


## 1. Header 

#### The header includes a hamburger menu, which opens from the left side, sliding over the page. From this menu the user can  reach others pages in the website. More than this, the header includes the title of the game positioned in the middle. The header is included in all pages, supporting a coherent appearance. 

#### The navbar includes links to:  homepage, instruction,  contact me and start the game 

## 2. Footer 
#### The footer section includes links to my social media profiles on facebook, twitter as well as the copyright information to my name. As well as the header, even the footer is present in all pages. 


## 3. Homepage
#### When entering the Homepage the user is directly diving into the game by seeing a video on auto-play. The video is telling a story, leading to the players task in the game, to hunt and destroy Corona viruses, that leaked in a research laboratory.Underneath the video, centered in the page, a start button allows the user to directly access the game board an start playing. 

##  4. Start the game - Game board  
#### The game board is kept in a simple design and includes the game “Hunt the virus”. The game, which is based on minesweeper, consists of a 10x10 grid of cells. Ten percent of the 100 cells include a virus, represented by an icon. The other cells include numbers, giving hints to the viruses location. Once the user opens a “Virus cell”, the game is lost and a pop-up box tells him or her “The virus got you!”. After clicking “OK” the game restarts automatically. If the user manages to open all cells without touching a virus, the game is won and he receives a box telling “You found the viruses!”.

## 5. Instructions
#### The instructions page includes to text-boxes. The first of the containing instructions on how to play the game. The second one is giving short facts on the corona virus.

## 6. Contact me
#### The contact page includes a contact form in a clean design. It enables the user to fill in his or her name, e-mail adress as well as a message that will be submitted to my e-mail account. 


## Features to be developed in the future  

- Different game levels to choose from (simple, hard, medium)
