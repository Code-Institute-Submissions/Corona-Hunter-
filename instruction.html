<h1>HOW TO PLAY </h1>

<p>Instructions for MineSweeper
Quick Start:

You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain viruses, others dont. If you click on a square containing a virus, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any viruses) you win.
Clicking a square which doesnt have a virus reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing viruses. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the viruses.
To open a square, point at the square and click on it. <br>


Detailed Instructions:

A squares (neighbours) are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals. Squares on the sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not wrap around the edges.
If you open a square with 0 neighboring viruses, all its neighbors will automatically open. This can cause a large area to automatically open.

  <h1>COVID‑19 pandemic</h1>

  <p>The COVID‑19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). The outbreak was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March.[7] As of 30 August 2020, more than 24.9 million cases of COVID‑19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 842,000 deaths; more than 16.4 million people have recovere.

  </p>

  <p>
   The virus is spread primarily via nose and mouth secretions including small droplets produced by coughing,[b] sneezing, and talking. The droplets usually do not travel through air over long distances. However, those standing in close proximity may inhale these droplets and become infected.[c] People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.[10][11] The transmission may also occur through smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time in enclosed spaces.[14] It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.</p>
