    <p>You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain VIRUESES (bombs), others don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.
Clicking a square which doesn't have a VIRUS reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing viruses. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the viruses.
To open a square, point at the square and click on it. </p>
