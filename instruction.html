      <h4>HOW TO PLAY</h4>
      <br /><br /><p>

      Instructions for Hunt the virus: You are presented with a board of
      squares. Some squares contain viruses, others don't. If you click on a
      square containing a virus, you lose. If you manage to click all the
      squares (without clicking on any viruses) you win. Clicking a square which
      doesnt have a virus reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing
      viruses. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the viruses.
      To open a square, point at the square and click on it.
      <br />

      Detailed Instructions: A squares (neighbours) are the squares adjacent
      above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals. Squares on the sides of
      the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not wrap
      around the edges. If you open a square with 0 neighboring viruses, all its
      neighbors will automatically open. This can cause a large area to
      automatically open.<br /><br />

      <h4>COVID‑19 pandemic</h4>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
      The COVID‑19 pandemic, also known as the corona virus pandemic, is an
      ongoing global pandemic of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused
      by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). The
      outbreak was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World
      Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of
      International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March. As of
      30 August 2020, more than 24.9 million cases of COVID‑19 have been
      reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more
      than 842,000 deaths; more than 16.4 million people have recovere. The
      virus is spread primarily via nose and mouth secretions including small
      droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, and talking. The droplets usually
      do not travel through air over long distances. However, those standing in
      close proximity may inhale these droplets and become infected. People may
      also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching
      their face. The transmission may also occur through smaller droplets that
      are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time in
      enclosed spaces. It is most contagious during the first three days after
      the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear,
      and from people who do not show symptoms.<br /><br />
